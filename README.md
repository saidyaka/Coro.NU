Uses beautiful soup to pull data from NU websites and tweets when a new update regarding COVID19 is posted.

Also sends daily safety tweets.

If you are trying to use it change auth.py so you can tweet from your own account.

I have a crontab on all of them that run every few minutes to check for new updates, runs on a Raspberry Pi Zero W.

if you have any questions tweet me @CoroNu19
